# OpenAI-API-Prompting
### Prompting OpenAI-API to get a very basic implementation for a virtual assisstant chatbot.
### Models tried: gpt-3.5-turbo and text-davinci-003

### Which one performs better?
#### gpt-3.5-turbo servers are overloading at the moment.
#### text-davinci-003 sometimes drifting away from the conversation by generating very strange responses.

### Fine Tuning
#### Can't fine tune gpt-3.5-turbo.
#### Tried fine tuning text-davinci-003 using openai cli tools but no success.[Figuring it out]

### Chat Backlog-to maintain context and ensure the model doesn't drift away from the conversation.
